    <h1>Sim Zi Yi</h1>
    <h2>Just go with the flow, do what i love, love what i do</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Zi Yi. I'm 19 years old born on 23rd of June. I love to read especially diving into chinese
        literatures and poems.
        On the other hand, i do like to camp with my scout mates. I enjoy sharing opinions with them during the
        activities and we all hold the same goal which is volunteer to improve child's growth through scouts
        organization.
    </p>
    <p>Besides my hobby, i have my personal aim which is become a professional digital media artist. I hope that i
        could enhance my skills and generate ideas of society thoughts into projects. Kept doing good at what i am doing
        is my ultimate goal. This process will never be easy and i'm not gonna give up easily!</p>
